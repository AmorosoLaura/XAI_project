If this is true, it's just so ironic that they'd 1) hate the appearance of their own emperor and what most people would consider \"japanese\" (i.e. Yayoi) racial features, and 2) continue to actively discriminate against and consider the very minorities who have supposedly superior \"Jomon\" features to be inferior, as we saw with the whole Nike ad fiasco and many other examples just recently. It just shows how illogical it all is, but I doubt it's even true in the first place and it's probably just some fantastical concoction that is not worth wasting time over, this is obvious why waste time on Asians !",
