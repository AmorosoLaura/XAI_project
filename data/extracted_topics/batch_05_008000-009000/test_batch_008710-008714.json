WHO KNEW CANADA ACTUALLY HAD A WHITE CAUCUS?! WHO WILL THIS REALLY PROTECT? THE WHITE RAPISTS! HOW AND WHY? WELL, IN THE US, WHERE THEY'RE NOT SCARED OF KEEPING RACIAL CRIME STATS, WE LEARN THAT THERE'S HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WHITE-ON-WHITE RAPES EVERY YEAR, BUT EXACTLY ZERO BLACK-ON-WHITE CASES OF RAPE - NOT EVEN IN THE MOST DEMOCRAT-CONTROLLED STATES, OR EVEN IN THE MOST WHITEST OF CITIES, WHERE THE MAYORS, CHIEFS OF POLICE AND COPS ARE ALL WHITES! SO WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR A JUDGE TO BE \"TRAINED\" ABOUT WHITES IN RAPE CASES?",
