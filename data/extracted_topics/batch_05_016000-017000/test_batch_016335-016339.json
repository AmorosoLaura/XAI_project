After an hour or so she found a little black dog to play with. I wasn't sure if I should have grabbed her away and made her play with other children instead of a dog. But I decided to let them play and try to talk to her about playing with kids later. I'm not sure if she is too young for this talk or not?

That black dog stuck out like a sore thumb. FYI, let me add that the black dogs owner was no where in site for over an hour...",
