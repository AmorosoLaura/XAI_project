The government, who are not the extreme right (nor ar they nazis), members of parliament and some other parties recognised the concerns towards mass immigration. I want to believe majority of the people are good and would help those who really are in need. Unfortunately this isnt the case and most immigrants are lazy and get support for free, while we have to work all day and pay mortgages. I would guess it's similar in Poland and other countries. Also important fact in this whole game is that we literally have like a thousands of immigrants in Slovakia, so the threat is growing.
