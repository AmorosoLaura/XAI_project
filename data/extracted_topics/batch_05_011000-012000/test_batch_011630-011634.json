And i started searching on the internet on this topic. We all see Adolf Hitler as a monster, and those who helped him carry out these atrocities against humanity. BUT why do we then call Hitler terrifying monster for his belief in the Aryan kingdom, but on the other hand, ISLAM for The religion of peace, for Islam's participation in the mass murder of 7 million Jews of our human population on earth ?...
