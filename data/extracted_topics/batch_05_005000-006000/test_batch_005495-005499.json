Two goddamn years later and I'm still white knuckling the entire 200 miles. God forbid she wants to take a drink of her water we'll swerve across two lanes. She never notices speed limit changes. She sees a cop and she'll slam on her brakes even if she wasn't speeding. She'll see a cow on the side of the road and freak out about how cute it is (cows are cute? What?) and start crossing lanes and shit. My palms are so sweaty it's hard to type this.I think I might need a new girlfriend lol",
