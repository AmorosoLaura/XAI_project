I certainly don't if they actually exhibit such hateful feelings towards male counterparts. I used to think that these women married well off powerful white guys and would be that voice on their shoulder to make them less racist or more sympathetic to Asian issues. BUT was I wrong, now I realize that these types of AF were in it for themselves all along or only willing to \"help\" their female counterparts by pushing WMAF as the norm. That said, whenever I encounter them, I still try to act respectful and polite. Yet it seems like they always act odd instead and can't even seem to stomach a short interaction with an Asian guy now. Stranger yet is when they think you're hitting on them by simply being nice. ",
