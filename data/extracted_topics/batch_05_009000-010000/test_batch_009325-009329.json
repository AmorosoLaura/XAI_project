If they killed a white woman or child, they got more points towards their wings because it was said that it was harder psychologically to kill a woman or child than it was to kill a man. Fifteen whites were killed including one white man who was kidnapped at gunpoint and had his limbs cut off and teeth pulled out while still alive.
