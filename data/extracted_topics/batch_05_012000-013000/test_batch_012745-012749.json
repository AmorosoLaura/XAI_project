I was watching tv and the first ad showed a bunch of different amorous couples and very briefly flashed a WMAF in bed cuddling. Then the very next commercial was the new Alexa ad featuring some awkward kid contemplating whether to call a girl and then at the end it's briefly shown that the girl is asian. WTF? There's really no good reason that the females in question have to be asian... but there it is. No asian males portrayed to meet their \"diversity\" quota. Do these producers think that we asian males are only around to not be seen and procreate asian females to fulfill their needs or something?",
