Those people populated the southern US when they emigrated, the same areas with large slave populations. He thus states that such behaviour in nigger communities in the US share more in common with those redneck white communities than with any heritage of their own, and that such behaviour shouldn't be considered 'black'' and shouldn't be defended as part of the niggers cultural identity in any way.
