I certainly don't know if they actually exhibit hateful feelings towards male counterparts and I would never presume to know what they feel. I used to think that these women married well off powerful white guys and would be that voice on their shoulder to make them more sympathetic to Asian issues. But this line of thinking is so fucked up. Yes they have had a different background to me and sometimes they see me as being nice as flirting but i've realised that so many of them have led very sheltered lives.",
