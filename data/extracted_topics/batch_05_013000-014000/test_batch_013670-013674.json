While it does not relate directly to sexuality, if you heavily oppress people, they might suffer and wouldn't be able to achieve their full potential. Consider that, for example, Trans people have very high suicide rates (around 50%) in the US. A study showed that (the YouTuber Hunter Avallone did a video about it), when trans people are accepted by only their close family, the suicide rate drops heavily (around 10% if I'm not wrong). If you oppress people because of their sexuality to the point that they're suicidal, they won't be able to prosper.",
