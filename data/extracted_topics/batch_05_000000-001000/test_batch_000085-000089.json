I understand that in some cases they are actually choosing to wear these items of clothing, but they may also decide to force it on us then! They may view it differently then others do. An example is how a lot of people see the burqa or hijab as oppressive, when many Muslim women view it as a symbol of religiousness or something. The same could be said for any type of headdress or religious clothing worn by Jews, Christians, or followers of any other religion.
