I'm not Russian but I still consider them part of my race and that's how I considered Jewish people. I'm surprised no one else here grew up the same way. Come on, when we saw a Stephen Spielberg film, did none of you consider him one of us? I thought of him as one of us. I admit this because I don't get how people don't understand Americans ultra positive view of Jews and why hardly any white families have a problem with their kids intermarrying with them. Jews have infiltrated and driven the narrative of who they are in relation to us for decades now. We can thank our universities and Hollywood for that.",
