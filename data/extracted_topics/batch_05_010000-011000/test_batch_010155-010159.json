But the only way to reject rejection is to stay alone. Loneliness also destroys them. They hate both. Loneliness is a killer while rejection is overkill. Because of this, if you love her she controls you, it's her way of phasing out rejection completely. But if you don't love her, you control her. Give a woman the cold shoulder but not flat out rejection and she's like putty in your hands. Don't use this fact to get a woman.
