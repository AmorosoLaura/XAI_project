Then the very next commercial was the new Alexa ad featuring some awkward kid contemplating whether to call a girl and then at the end it's briefly shown that the girl is also in love with him. WTF? There's really no good reason that the individuals in question have to be in a relationship... but there it is. No individuals portrayed to be happy if they are single. Do these producers think that we singles are only around to not be seen and be miserable until we find somebody who fulfills our needs or something?"",
