Yes I get it you want to make life better for the future generations - awesome 100% support that, however giving them luxuries beyond what our own society is able to afford isn't fair..

I get it, being in charge of fixing a world like ours sucks, however since when did they become more important in the world than everyone else? I'm sorry but that isn't equality.",
