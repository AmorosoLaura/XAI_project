The political elite and the voting class don't know these things so of course they're not going to be exercised by anti-indigenous racism because they don't know it exists but I can assure you that a key part of the reason why we got the vote we did, despite the demonisation level is that in significant parts of Britain you've got a working class or a lower middle class native population who have personally experienced or whose family gone through some degree of racism either from local councils or from the police or from the local media or from certain members of ethnic minorities and they are at they're wits end that no-one will talk about it, if they take it to the police the police say, 'well what's wring with you? Are you a racist? Did you encourage it and so on' and so amongst those people there is a very clear understanding of the fact that there is a very large problem with anti-majority racism in this country."",
