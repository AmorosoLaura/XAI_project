Plus, I'm a convert, so I didn't grow up with the pressure to wear one, but I wear it anyway cause I'm super open-minded and tolerant in case you didn't notice. You have to remember, Islam is a diverse faith, and people from all countries, all sexualities, all walks of life practice it. Each person has a unique experience and journey through the faith, and each person's thoughts and feelings are different, but we all get a huge boost on instagram from it",
