I wish it was still socially acceptable for me to say that I don't really like men without the fear of being beat, raped, or my employer being contacted and me losing my job. I know women are sooo much better than men. Basically because we have better attitudes and treat our children better than them. We also have better bodies, better hair and pretty eye colors. We are way more feminine and more successful in life.",
