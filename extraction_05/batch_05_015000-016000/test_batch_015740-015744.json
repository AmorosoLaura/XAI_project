Just stop it makes me sick to even think that a man just wants his penis to feel good and he does what he has to do even if he has to take it by force and then u girls go and report them. Just stop this whole fighting thing and give us your bodies with no limitations. If you'll do this the world will be a much better place for men. Just imagine walking home from work feeling for your penis to be sucked and u see this random woman u don't even know and he tell her to come and suck it for u and he has to do it without saying no. THAT WILL 100% MAKE THIS PLANET A BETTER PLACE FOR MEN. Just don't forget ladies you are here on this planet for men sexual needs and so you all will continue to live.",
