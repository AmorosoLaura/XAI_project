Closely related to this accusation is the charge that they're grooming boys for sex. Every gay man with whom I've ever interacted about these subjects has categorically denied them, and to a man, they seemed as repulsed at the idea of pedophilia as I was. And personally, I do actually believe them. It's true that ''man boy love' was often celebrated in gay circles throughout recorded history.It's also true that, to this day, there is more ''intergenerational' dating among gay men.It's also true that infamous pedophile groups like NAMBLA were at the forefront of the modern gay activist movement. And it's true that some of the most celebrated gay icons, including Allen Ginsberg and Larry Kramer, spoke sympathetically of NAMBLA and the like. (To be clear, they endorsed ''fully consensual man-boy relationships,' as if such a thing were morally possible.)'  However, MICHAEL BROWN states that he  'IS NOT EQUATING HOMOSEXUAL PRACTICE WITH PEDOPHILIA'. This statement clearly illustrates his hate and If any of you believe what this nutter is saying you should be charged with homophobia.",
