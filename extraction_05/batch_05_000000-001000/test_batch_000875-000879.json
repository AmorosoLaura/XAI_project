How is it Islamophobia when the problem is based purely upon cold hard reality? How much can a society of people take when they are assaulted and murdered over and over again by another single race of people doing it for their religion? When you have to wonder if every Muslim you see is a murderer or not, you've got to assume each one is. How the hell can anybody live like that? Why should anybody listen to Linda Sarsour, she is insane, malicious, and arrogant. So are all who stand with her, even if they are White. Of course we have the right to do something about it. They should be grateful to be here and we are perfectly permitted to kick them out if they're unsuited to be in a White country that is not their own. Kick them out, keep them out, let them fight over their own lands.",
