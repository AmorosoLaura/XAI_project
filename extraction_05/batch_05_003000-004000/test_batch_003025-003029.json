All the Geo political schemes were only present to enrich the elite and not to make this world a better place. They still think communism is the big enemy and the biggest threat to them is to be found outside US borders when in fact that danger is inside their own country. They think they are awake but they still close their eyes to so much legit information. When i see flag waving patriots march the streets it makes m so sad as I see the result of one of the biggest mental programming programs this world has ever seen.. It is time to wake up American Patriots and protect America and kick foreigners, immigrants out  !!!",
