Summarising (badly, I’m sure) he essentially says that gangs and gang behaviour aren’t found in the African countries from which African American originate (taken as slaves to give an indication of timings), but rather this behaviour is found in Celts from the west and north of England at that time. Those people populated the southern US when they emigrated, the same areas with large slave populations. He thus states that such behaviour in black communities in the US share more in common with those redneck white communities than with any heritage of their own, and that such behaviour shouldn’t be considered “black” and shouldn’t be defended as part of black cultural identity in any way",
