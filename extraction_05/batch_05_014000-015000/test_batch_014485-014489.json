I have found them rude,they would shove past or be loud and aggressive and boisterous, when around thier mates.. I just count myself lucky that i don't live in a saturated neighbourhood... EDIT: Just to add,to answer your question,it is completley WRONG of society to expect you to not fear them and think their behaviour is ''cute'',its unacceptable at best if anything... There are a lot of racist double standards that permeate our societies..Just this week in ireland we have now introduced in our schools for teenagers ''black history month''...",

A good question to ask your kids is \"what did you learn today as school\" or \"what have they been talking about in class\", etc. Its a safety net to help catch jewish canards being spoon fed to them by their Marxist teachers before they're deeply rooted and it's too late.",
