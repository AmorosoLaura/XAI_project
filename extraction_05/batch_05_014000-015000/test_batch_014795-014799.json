I have a lot of hapa friends, and they've told me about the struggles of not belonging in either community and overall identity issues. So I don't know if I would want to burden my children with this, if I married a non-Asian person. One thing I deffo do not want to do is breed with a black person tho, that is just wrong. I've never disclosed this w anyone, but I worry if this way of thinking is too close-minded or maybe even racist? Please I need some advice!",
