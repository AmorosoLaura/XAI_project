Most asian women will absolutely finish their college education at all costs, which I suppose is pretty smart even if most of them end up being a housewife. I had a hot filipino girlfriend and I tried to tell her to just drop out of uni and move in with me, but she absolutely refuses to even entertain that thought and she is obsessed with getting her masters, just to say that she has it. She doesn‘t even know what she‘ll do with it. But her parents are from the third world so I guess that would make sense",
