You can imagine how many completely intellectually unsuitable candidates were permitted entry this year... They will also be looking at dropping proper exams for next year amongst many grades because of so much lost teaching time. Again, what metrics will be used to get a semi-objective idea of what a student knows or how they might perform but poorly considered, arbitrary teachers opinions. I raise this not because I don't trust teachers but because in class sizes as large and varied and where they teach so many kids each day/week/year how on earth can they give a fair, un-compromised, in-depth analysis of each kid?  I really think the repercussions will be enormous when all these dimwits will scrape through university because of grade inflation and come out worth shit in terms of skill and knowledge and worse still, with such arrogance that they deserved their little paper validating their 'studies' in the first place.",
