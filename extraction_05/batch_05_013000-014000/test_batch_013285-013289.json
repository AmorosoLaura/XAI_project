All tribes are not created equal. An easy way to size up the ancestry of Indians is to note the distance between shoulder and elbow. If they are close together meaning they have a short upper arm, they're probably related to Asian people. One thing I noticed about the tribes in Montana is they seem to interact with Indians of different tribes more than they do with whites.",
