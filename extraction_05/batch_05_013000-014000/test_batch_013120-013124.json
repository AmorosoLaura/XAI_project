For example a large portion of my family lives in Hungary on a small farm that has essentially been isolated for many years. I doubt any of my family have many kind words for the majority of refugees because of their limited experience. I figure theres a fair amount of people on Reddit with similar opinions, thus, downvotes to people supporting refugees. I am all for sending aid and doing what the government can to assist them. This to me and many other students is an opportunity to encounter refugees and a wider variety of people to not be closed minded",
