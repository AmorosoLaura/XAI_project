This family, who are moving out are the only ones to have committed any serious violent crime in the area in the few decades I've lived here. I came home from work one day and one of my neighbors was hosing off his walkway and there were a couple cop cars outside his house. I stopped to ask him what was going on. Apparently the crazy ex-wife went at the husband with a chef's knife and got him a few times in the chest. My neighbor, jolly as can be just casually washing all the coagulated blood of his walkway and stoop gave me the details. All in all I'm very pleased to have a safe area to live where neighbors say hello and have a chat, and there is no stabbings or trash in the yard.",
