Her entire personality trait is tiktok right down to the captions of her videos, the way she now talks and types. someone needs to set her straight. I don't think in my entire life I have ever came across a more basic, follower sheep than this tramp. She isn't fashionable, she just bought an oversized, overpriced and overdone race car jacket and stuck some baggy jeans on and decided that was her 'fit' she never dressed like this until a few months ago because everyone else was. She pains me. People who actually like fashion, study it etc should be HORRIFIED at this ratchet ass vanilla hoe coming for them. She also looks fucking ridiculous in those horrendous oversized blazers. She's a class A twat.",
