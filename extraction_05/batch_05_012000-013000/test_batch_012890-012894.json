For that reason, 1.5 million immigrants from the third world shall migrate to Europe every year.  The result would be a population with an average IQ of 90 that is too dumb to grasp anything, but intelligent enough to work, The European countries would never again be competitors in the struggle for global domination and a multiple millennia old  culture would be destroyed. Irrational people who will fight against this 'mingling of races', and put up any resistance against the global  world order, should be killed.'",
