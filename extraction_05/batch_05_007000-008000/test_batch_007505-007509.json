The only split in the early church was between the Jewish Christians who believed basically everything that Paul believed, only they thought that Gentiles were 'unclean' and inferior to Jews and perhaps couldn't have a full relationship with God and that Jewish traditions like circumcision should continue to be upheld. Paul however  was more inclusive and preached for a racially harmonious Christianity where 'there is no Jew or Greek for we are all one in Christ Jesus', and (presumably as the Greeks found circumcision unpalatable) wherein the Old Testament Jewish law is abolished and faith/righteousness is all that matters.
