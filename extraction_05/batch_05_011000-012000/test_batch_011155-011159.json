I get that you have the whole gender/sexuality change thing going on and its fun to play with that and stretch the limits of gendered terms, but long term its going to fuck up the language and make finding the threads we actually want inconvenient for everyone involved.

Lets not make things any more convoluted than they need to be, keeping up with all this is hard as it is and besides, they are becoming a real problem in society.
