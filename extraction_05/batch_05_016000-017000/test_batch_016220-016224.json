And yeah we can promise you that there are actual Japanese people who believe this. Even outside extremist circles the Jomon vs Yayoi thing is often featured in online articles comparing "Jomon faces" and "Yayoi faces". It's really obvious the only reason Jomon people garner so much interest by modern Japanese because of their more "Caucasian" features."",
