It's difficult not to give money to Jewish shareholders, so I prefer to keep my consumption low, that's probably the best way to hurt J3wish interests which relate to consumerism. Here in Europe we have some Nationalist brands (Thor Steinar, etc), but I find these to be somewhat of a double edged sword because you can become a target. That being said, I obviously avoid any brand literally created by a J3w because I just can't stand having the name of a kike on my clothing. Levi Strauss & Calvin Klein & Ralph Lauren comes to mind."" ,
