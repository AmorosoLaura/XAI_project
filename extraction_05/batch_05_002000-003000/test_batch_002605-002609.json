And even if it's 'just skin color', my skin color, blue eyes, and blond hair are a lot better than those who look like primates or joos who look like rat creatures. Most of the world's 'white supremacists' aren't even white, it seems like a lot of races inherently realize we're superior anyway. Like a filipino girl asked me once 'how does it feel to be god's favorite'. Is there any way to hypothetically untake the redpill? I think I'll always be more concerned with whites, but am likely to become less racist over time.",
