Nature intended for us to strive towards being the best, the smartest, the fastest, the strongest, and not mediocre, and not to regress to a lower ability. Hence, only the good genes should be spread, and bad genes should be eradicated. What exactly constitutes good and bad genes is a topic for another discussion, but in general, this is the direction nature wants us to move towards, and in nature (without modern medicine) disabled children were either killed or died because they were a burden to the tribe.",
