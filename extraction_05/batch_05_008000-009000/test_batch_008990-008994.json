Because of the amalgamation of cultures, it is not uncommon to have men of all heritage pursuing myself. When I have tried to explain in the past that I am not just attracted to men that are caucasian, I have been ridiculed. I remember one time, a man got super upset with me turning him down I thought he was going to hit me, but I managed to exit the bar I was at and caught a cab home. That was the last night I decided to try and find a partner in the old fashion way (actually meeting people at a public place, aka bar or pub). Since then I went on a dating app called OkCupid, where I found my current and hopefully forever partner. There are so many questions you can answer that will give a very good indication of your ethics, opinions, and beliefs. I am so lucky to have found him there, he is perfect!",
